*I outline why I chose to self-host a 'House Wiki' and how it's set up*

Owning a house can be a daunting thing. As a home-owner if something breaks in my home I'm responsible for fixing it. There's no landlord or superintendent that I can call - it's on me. And there are so many systems and appliances that can break. 

This kind of thing really brings out my data-hoarder / obsessive organizer side and so I started a wiki to keep track of it all. Any tidbit of information about my house gets filed neatly into the wiki.
