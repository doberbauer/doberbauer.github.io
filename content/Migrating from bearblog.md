I'm in the process of migrating this blog from bearblog.dev and there are still some things that need to be cleaned up - especially links and tables.
I really enjoyed using bearblog but opted to use GitHub Pages + Pelican because those tools give me more flexibility.

Do check out [bearblog](https://bearblog.dev/) though. [Herman](https://herman.bearblog.dev/) does great work.
