Title: Car Shopping Resources

Category: Resources

When I bought my first car I'll admit... I did the bare minimum of research. I was young and impulsive and when a friend of a friend announced they were selling a car I jumped on it. It was a 2001 VW Jetta GL and it was horrible. In the space of 2 years it needed a new engine, battery, and radiator and eventually a deeper cooling system issue put it out of its misery.

Fast forward to today and my attitude toward car shopping has changed considerably. I put in the time, did a ton of research and found a great reliable car.

Through that process I discovered some invaluable resources that either didn't exist or I didn't know of them when I bought my first car. I'd like to share them with you now. I've broken them into two separate categories, **Research** and **Shopping**. 

* I'm updating this list as I go. Some sections may be incomplete. I appreciate your patience.

* I'm not affiliated in any way with any of these sites. They helped me and I think they can help you too. 

# Research
## [Car Problem Zoo](https://www.carproblemzoo.com/)
Car Problem Zoo aggregates data from the U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and allows you to view how many recorded complaints there are for a particular vehicle. For example, the 2011 BMW 328 has 243 complaints in the Engine and Engine Cooling category as of this writing.

## [Car Complaints](https://wee.carcomplaints.com/) 
Car Complaints is a lot like Car Complaint Zoo. It aggregates useful complaint data about vehicles from reliable sources. Where it differs is that it includes complaints from users and lists them alongside the NHTSA ones. They also provide a system of grading cars based on user and official data.

## [NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls)
One of the most important resources in this collection. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) allows you to look up a vehicle by VIN and view any open recalls it has. These are components that have been found to be faulty and have been recalled by the manufacturer. If your vehicle has open recalls on it the manufacturer should replace them free of charge. Most dealerships will address open recalls prior to a sale.

## [CARFAX](https://www.carfax.com/) 
CARFAX is known for its CARFAX Vehicle History Reports. These are detailed logs of a vehicle's maintenance history. Whenever the owner brought the vehicle in to the dealership or participating mechanic for maintenance and repairs there will be a log of it in the CARFAX report. It's important to note that some people prefer to work on their own vehicles and so there will not be a record of whatever they've done on the CARFAX. 

## [Kelley Blue Book](https://www.kbb.com/)
Kelley Blue Book is a company that provides estimates of a vehicle's value based on a number of factors. 

## [Dashboard Light](https://www.dashboard-light.com/)
Dashboard Light offers a "long term quality index" which is a measure of a vehicle's reliability over the course of its life.

## [VIN Audit](https://www.vinaudit.com/)
VIN Audit is a lot like CARFAX. It's a company that provides detailed reports about a vehicle's maintenance history.

## [Lemon Squad](https://lemonsquad.com/) 
Lemon Squad provides pre-purchase inspections for used vehicles. They operate all over the U.S. and will go wherever the vehicle is.

# Tips
- Get a pre-purchase inspection. Most mechanics offer this as a service. There's also Lemon Squad above.
- Check NHTSA for open recalls. If you have open recalls they can be taken care of for free by the dealership.
- Check the CARFAX or VIN Audit every time.
